***Lung Segmentation of Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-affected Lungs***

**Project Overview**


This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform lung segmentation from chest X-ray images, focusing on three categories:

-Normal Lungs

-Viral Pneumonia-affected Lungs

-COVID-19-affected Lungs

By utilizing the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset, the CNN model is designed to accurately identify and segment lung regions as a preliminary step for the diagnosis of these lung conditions. This project aims to support healthcare professionals by automating the detection process, potentially enhancing early intervention.

**Dataset**

The project uses the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset, which contains chest X-ray images categorized into:

-Normal

-Viral Pneumonia

-COVID-19

Each image undergoes preprocessing before being fed into the CNN model for segmentation and classification.

Model Training
The CNN model is trained using the chest X-ray images from the dataset. Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model performance.

Model Architecture: The CNN model consists of several convolutional layers, followed by pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.

Training: The model is trained with training and validation data splits, using optimization techniques to reduce overfitting.

**Regularization and Optimization Techniques**
We implemented three optimization techniques to improve the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting:

-Dropout Regularization

-Batch Normalization

-Adam Optimizer

-Results

After training the CNN model, the performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations of lung segmentation outputs are saved in the results/ directory.
